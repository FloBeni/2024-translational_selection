This archive includes all processed data that have been generated and used in the paper 'Non-adaptive mechanisms are the primary drivers of codon usage in metazoans', as well as the scripts used to analyze the data and to generate the figures.

### Directories content

-   The folder 'figure' contains the necessary materials to produce the figures of the manuscript:

    -   Intermediate pannels generated by R scripts to produce figures are stored in the directory 'pannels'.

    -   Stable images used in pannels are stored in 'images_library'.

    -   Directories labeled with the extension '\_generator' contain R scripts used to produce figures.

    -   The remaining directories are where the figures are stored.

-   The 'data' directory contains processed data in tab-separated text format, which is used for generating figures and conducting analyses.

    -   The 'per_species' directory contains compressed tab-separated text format files for each of the 257 studied species. Each species possesses a directory '*`Scientific name`*\_NCBI.taxid*`taxID`*', within can be found a subdirectory with the *`assembly accession`*.

        -   'codon_usage_gene_fpkm' encompasses the occurrences of codons within exonic regions and triplet sequences within intronic regions, assessed for each coding sequence. Gene expression metrics, including mean_fpkm, median_fpkm, or weighted_fpkm, are derived from GTDrift and compiled for analysis.

        -   'decoding_table.tab.gz' contains information regarding the gene copy count per tRNA. Additionally, it delineates whether a codon is translated via Watson-Crick base pairing with the most prevalent tRNA for a given amino acid or through wobble pairing, which occurs when the corresponding tRNA is absent.

        -   'tRNAscan.tab.gz' consist of annotated copies obtained from the GFF files downloaded from NCBI.

        -   'tRNAscan_SE.tab.gz' comprises annotated copies generated by the tRNAscan-SE tool, executed through the command line:
        
        

    -   'Data1_supp.tab' encompasses per species data on life history traits, number of identified genes among the eukaryota BUSCO gene set, and the number of genes that have been associated to one annotated protein-coding gene only (Fig. 1,2,3,5,6,7,8).

-   The 'pipelines' folder contains the bionformatics pipelines for three different purposes: to download data from repository; to analyze various characteristics as part of our study ('codon_usage_pipeline'); to generate data table located in the 'data' directory ('data_generator').

### 

Some packages that you may encounter in these R scripts should be install: - stringr - kableExtra - cowplot - ggplot2 - imager - RColorBrewer ...

### 

The script 'values_in_text_paper_generator.R' retrieves the values found in the main text of the paper from the data.
